    "A new Paralympic cycling relay competition involves competitors of different disability levels making up a team of three. \n",

    "<br>A legal relay team for a 9 point relay may, for example, consist of two D4 cyclists and a D1 cyclist (4+4+1 = 9 and 9 <= 9), or a D5 cyclist, a D2 cyclist and a D1 cyclist (5+2+1 = 8 and 8 <= 9). \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>Write a program that checks the legality of relay teams given the country and the disability rating of the entrant for each relay leg. \n",
    "<br>It should deal with invalid input as in the test plan (eg the total points rating allowed for a team must be greater than or\n",
